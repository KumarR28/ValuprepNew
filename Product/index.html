<h3>Welcome to ValuePrep</h3>
<p align="justify">Let’s face it:  Most people are not interested in spending their precious time filling out tax forms.  One of the main reasons people resort to doing their own taxes is because they cannot find a tax 
preparerer they can fully trust or rely on.  So, even though people find filling out tax returns to be
a daunting task and a challenge to navigate the ever changing tax laws, they resort to trying to 
complete their own tax returns anyway using some sort of online tax tool such as TurboTax.

<div class="span11"><h3>Why Choose Valuprep?</h3>
<h6></h6>
<p align="justify">Our mission is simple: prepare accurate tax returns at the most reasonable fee possible
while focusing on the needs of our clients and treating them with the respect that they deserve.
Our goal is not just to do your tax return one year but rather to form a lasting relationship by earning
your trust.  We understand that most clients are not just looking for "a tax guy"; they are looking for
 some who always has the clients' best interest in mind.  We strive to offer the highest quality professional
service whether your tax returns are relatively simple or complex.  Your success is our success.  And we can
work with you to identify potential opportunities within the tax code to reduce your future tax liabilities
through thoughtful tax planning.  We can even review a prior-year return prepared by you or any other 
tax preparer for any missed opportunities.  We understand that you do not have the time to study the 
tax code.  That's why we are there to help you every step of the way.  At most franchised tax preparation 
companies your returns are generally prepared by someone with minimum training (sometimes as little
as a few weeks!)  At Valuprep, your tax return will be prepared by an honest, knowledgeable, and most
importantly, qualified CPA who is registered with the IRS.
